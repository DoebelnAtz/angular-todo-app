# angular-todo

This is a simple angular TODO app

[live][1]

to run locally

client:

    cd client && npm start

backend:

requires google service account keyfile

add keys.json to server/functions/src

    cd server/functions && npm run serve

This is my first project using angular and firebase, if you have
any suggestions on improvements let me know :)
